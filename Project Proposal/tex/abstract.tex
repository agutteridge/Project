The volume of biomedical literature available online is in an upward trend. Though this heightened discourse within the scientific community is of inarguable benefit, there also comes the task of searching for relevant information, which currently is imposed on the user. The project as outlined in this proposal is a web application that provides a visual interface through which users can explore the citations retrieved from a bibliographic database, thereby focusing their search. Herein, the various online sources of bibliographic data are discussed, with PubMed and its associated API chosen as the most appropriate resource. The various scenarios of user interaction are explored, in order to rationalise the objectives and select the appropriate technologies for the project. Python web frameworks and JavaScript libraries are compared and contrasted, leading to the proposed usage of Django and D3, respectively. A development plan is outlined for the project and any additional features, time permitting.
