\section{Project Overview}
	Since the actualisation of the World Wide Web, the rate at which ideas, theories and innovations are spreading has increased dramatically. Researchers publish their findings in peer-reviewed academic journals, a format which has become progressively more plentiful due to digitisation. Databases such as DBLP for the Computer Sciences and PubMed for the Biomedical Sciences categorise and index articles in order to make them accessible via online interfaces. However, these services often produce lists, not exactly what the user is searching for. The aim of this project is to produce a web application that provides an additional user interface to PubMed that is primarily visual, allowing the user to explore their search results in relation to a topic of interest, or the global location of the authors and institutions listed in the data of the articles.
