\section{Project Overview}
Since the actualisation of the World Wide Web, the rate of the spread of ideas, theories and innovations has increased dramatically. Within academia, researchers are able to publish their findings in peer-reviewed academic journals more rapidly than ever before, which are then indexed by databases such as DBLP for the Computer Sciences and PubMed for the Biomedical Sciences. This format, as well as conference proceedings, clinical trial reports and patents, has become progressively more plentiful and accessible due to digitisation. This wealth of information necessitates sophisticated tools to aid users in attaining meaningful results that cannot be derived from the built-in search engine alone: one study has shown that more than a third of PubMed queries return over 100 results\cite{dogan}. The primary aim of this project is to improve the flexibility, and ultimately accuracy, of searching or browsing through scholarly literature on PubMed.
