nice sentence:
Enrich and inform the search routine of users by visualising information extracted from the title, abstract, and bibliographic data of the retrieved PubMed citations.

The key features of this project are the usage and integration of citation retrieval, semantic categorisation and geocoding services, enabling the gap between services currently available online (basic search, some visualisation but little), and those developed by researches/ those working at UMLS, and are not available or even known outside of the academic circles they were created by, to be bridged. The key technologies: MetaThesaurus and MetaMap, will be discussed in brief.??
