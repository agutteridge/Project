\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Project Background}
\subsection{The Problem}
The last few decades have seen the availability of digital content dramatically increase, as adoption of the World Wide Web and other internet technologies became widespread both at home and in the workplace. Academic publishing was soon to capitalise on this trend, with long-established journals such as Nature creating websites for all aspects of the publishing pipeline, from submission to publication of papers online, in the '90s\cite{nature-history}. This increase in accessibility has contributed toward an exponential growth of literature\cite{hunter-cohen} that can make the search for relevant papers challenging in the present day. PubMed, a freely-available online database for medical texts maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information of the United States, is a mainstay for many users in the health and academic sectors, and is accessed by millions of users daily\cite{dogan}. However, the web interface presents a simplistic approach to information retrieval, with minimal analysis of results and a relatively steep learning curve for achieving satisfactory results with text queries alone. WRAP UP

\subsection{Related Work}
A great deal of work has been carried out on the analysis and optimisation of PubMed as a service. The proposal discussed a small number of web applications that allow users to view citations in different ways, such as through the generation of static graphs with GoPubMed\cite{gopubmed}, or by creating a social network-like web application for authors with Microsoft Academic Search\cite{mas}. Of note, GoPubMed implements a text recognition algorithm in order to extract terms that are known to belong to a specific hierarchical vocabulary, the Gene Ontology. Citations are then associated with these terms, allowing efficient categorisation and therefore retrieval upon the execution of a relevant query. To my knowledge, GoPubMed does not disambiguate terms, which may result in a lower success rate of assigning vocabulary entries to papers. This approach is adopted by NAME RELATED ??

\subsection{Objectives}
Upon completion, it was envisioned that this application would:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Investigate the utility of citation data retrieved from PubMed, particularly with relation to:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Semantic keywords mined from the title, abstract, keywords and Medical Subject Headings,
	\item Addresses as listed in the author affiliations,
	\end{itemize}
\item Organise medical/biological concepts into a hierarchy parseable by a client-side library,
\item Display these data in relation to each citation in a web browser, and enable the user to interact with elements of the webpage.
\end{enumerate}

The sections of this report comprise the following: the main features of the application and the project specification are outlined in Chapter 2. The organisation of the software architecture is introduced in Chapter 3. The separate components of the application are explored in further detail in Chapter 4, including background information concerning the external services, where possible. Methods of testing and optimisation are presented in Chapter 5, and the report is concluded in Chapter 6, within which the merits, limitations and future developments of the project are discussed.
