\chapter{Project Overview}
The key features of the application are introduced in this chapter. The system is described primarily from the perspective of the user, as the back-end processes are focused on in later chapters of this report. 

\section{Features}
The web application is a contained within a single page, that is, all POST and GET requests do not result in a redirect, but instead dynamically update to reflect new data. A user will start by entering a text query into the form, and pressing 'search' (Figure \ref{screen1}).
