Tools available for exploring literature in the biomedical domain are scarce, with websites such as PubMed adopting an information-intensive user interface that supplies users with long lists of text. This report presents a web application that visualises the topics and bibliographic information contained in citation data retrieved from PubMed. These data are enriched by a series of semantic and geographical knowledge sources that are accessed server-side: biomedical concepts are organised hierarchically according to the Unified Medical Language System, and author institutions are geographically mapped by a geocoding service. The software architecture, implementation of the numerous components of the application, and an evaluation of the system are detailed herein. By presenting citations in this fashion, the application aims to contextualise biomedical literature, firstly within the set of results retrieved by the search term, but also in relation to real-world structures.
